# NOTICE:
# There is no builtin or example mpv.conf with all the default values; this file will try to be that.
# To see all the default values for most options, call mpv with --list-options:
	#$ mpv --list-options
# Furthermore, to see the value of an specific option, pipe it into grep:
	#$ mpv --list-options | grep screenshot

# All the necessary details about each option (and more) is well documented on the reference manual:
# https://mpv.io/manual/master
# A local copy is also available at ~/.config/mpv/manual.pdf

# In addition to the manual, mpv(1) manpage also has detailed description of the syntax.
#
# Configuration files are read system-wide from /usr/local/etc/mpv.conf
# and per-user from ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf, where per-user settings override
# system-wide settings, all of which are overridden by the command line.

# Configuration file settings and the command line options use the same
# underlying mechanisms. Most options can be put into the configuration file
# by dropping the preceding '--'. See the man page for a complete list of
# options.

# Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored.

# Profiles should be placed at the bottom of the configuration file to ensure
# that settings wanted as defaults are not restricted to specific profiles.

# Once again. Reference the manual at all times. It is exceptionally well written and documented.

# The options declared as part of profiles override global default settings, but ONLY take effect when

# Otherwise, to activate a profile, initialize mpv with the profile option --profile=profile_name:
	#$ mpv --profile=big-cache example.mkv
# OR by setting the `profile` variable above, so mpv knows which profile to use as the default.


# The following profile can be enabled on the command line with: --profile=nya
